Create `lib/src/ui/screens/home.dart`:
- AppBar with title (`appTitle` from localization) and a language‐switcher icon
- Below, a vertically‐centered welcome text (`homeWelcome`)
- A “View Cars” button that navigates to `CarListScreen`
Implement responsive padding so it looks good on mobile and web.
Show me the full Dart code for `HomeScreen`.
