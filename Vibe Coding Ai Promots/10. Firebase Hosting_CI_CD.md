Generate a `firebase.json` and `firebaserc` that:
- Deploys `build/web` to Hosting
- Configures rewrites so all routes serve `index.html`
Also write a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that:
- On push to `main`, runs `flutter build web` then `firebase deploy --only hosting`
Show me both config files.
